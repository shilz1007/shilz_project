Satisfied : I Love My Tiago. Tata Tiago's smooth and spirited engine really improves my driving experience. The sole drawback is the 3-cylinder engine's moderately loud operation.

'Value for Money : Best Car In Its Segment, Better Than Swift..Nice car for people who want safety, features and mileage. If you want a car for your family, so this is the best one. It doesn't offer those fancy features which i10 Nios offers and it also doesn't look dated. Most important it is value for money. Many people say that Tata service cost is high but trust me it's cheaper. Moreover if compared to swi...'
'Excellent Design : It Is Awesome. This is a nice car with an awesome design. I just loved the car model as well, would love to buy it; it's really awesome.'

'Value for Money : Go For It! Tremendous Build Quality!. This is a value for money car. The average is good, the car is sturdy, kerb weight is good, but the gearbox is not smooth, I had to change the clutch plate after driving 22600 km. Earlier I drove M800 and that was really smooth. This Tiago XZ Petrol is not as smooth as Maruti. Engine noise is also there. But overall I am happy with the purchase.'
Functionality Issues : Quite A Great Car..The car was pretty good for the price but I really expected a lot. I really think tata has done a great job with this car. Few places where I think they could've done better are the power lock, a bit more styling, and a better infotainment system. The rear parking camera is quite bad and with the anti-glare screen, the parking screen is not that gr...

Safety and Value : Best Car In The Segment..Best car in the segment. 4-star Global NCAP safety crash test rating. Value for money. Strong and sturdy built quality. Low maintenance car.
'Performance Issues: Performance And Comfort. The gear knob is vibrating. For example, in the 1.2 L engine segment in competitors like Hyundai I10 NIOS, SWIFT doesn't have this issue. It's better if tata could rectify the issue. The engine sounds louder due to 3 cylinders. A driving seat is a bit of discomfort for a 90 kg weight person to sit. The overall driving experience is good.
'Disappointing : Worst Experience. Nice comfortable car but there are certain issues. The plastic used is 3rd grade, very cheap cost-cutting. I have driven 6000+ km but mileage is still very less. Get around 15 in the city and 17 on the highway. It's all rubbish if the company is saying a mileage of 24. In just my first year of purchasing, the vehicle broke down and when I contacted...', , car: Tata Tiago

After 14 days the front tire was ruptured, not a flat tire but a big rupture. shocking! Now as the service Center is telling no guarantee for tires. Just having driven barely 200 km local and tire gone. There is talk about Tata Tiago's safety features...

Design Flaws : Design Issues..I bought the car two weeks back. It performs well. The engine has a little vibration due to the 3 cylinder compared to the more refined 4 cylinder. I found two issues disturbing in the interior design. 1. The extreme right ac vent for the driver is too close to the steering wheel. the cool air flow directly hits our right hand and chills it. even i..., ,

Performance, driving pleasure, and handling are mind-blowing for this price. Mileage is 11.5 in the city for AMT with AC fully on and 18 on highways. NVH levels are minimum and AMT response is a lot better than before. A driver's paradise at a price worth a steal.'
Mechanical Issues : Good Product But Many Mechanical Flaws.Overall very good product in driving wise, decent milage, but tata has to work on mechanical glitches, a lot of vibrations & rattle noise, flimsy plastic fit & finish, worst of them all this car engine jolts like something is stopping fuel supply in 2nd-3rd gear, which can result fatally if the user is on the highway. car:Tata Tiago
Versatile : A Good Buy. Amazing Experience, it's a perfect vehicle to drive on city roads and transforms into a beast on the highways.
'Poor Customer Service : No Respect For Customer..No service. Sales executives themselves are not interested in TATA cars. I had a bad experience with TATA. No Value for customer time. I will advise everyone to avoid TATA.'
Great Fuel Efficiency : Best Mileage More Than Expected..I have Tata Tiago petrol car and petrol car's company mileage is 25kmpl but I got 28kmpl mileage in my car. And I have proof of this. I have taken a picture of my speedometer with 28kmpl. I am very satisfied with Tata Tiago.

Reliability Issues : Long Term Review OF The Car..Tiago is a great car for city commutes. I bought this car in 2016, faced many technical issues with the old model, the gear vibrates a lot and the cabin noise is too much. The sound system is the best among the segments in the class.
