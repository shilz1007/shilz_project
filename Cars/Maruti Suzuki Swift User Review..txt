'Sporty and Comfortable : I Like Ignis More Than Other Cars. I liked it more than other cars. Driving is very soft and easy, the gearbox is placed properly, the suspension is Ok, the front look is very smart. Too much spacious cabin than Swift. Mileage is also above 19.5 km upon Indian roads. I took experience other cars, but the driving of Ignis is very sporty and comfortable. Only need a back headrest.'

'Good Overall, Puncture Issue : It Is A Good Car. I don't see any major problem in this car. Cons: It is always a headache when the tyre got punctured for it is very difficult to remove the flat tyre. Someone may please help me how to remove the flat tyre easily if there are any ways.'
'Suspension Issues : Only Problem Felt Is Suspension. After driving 2000+ in highways. Pros: Good high-speed stability. good performance, good handling dynamics, punchy engine, better build when compared to other Maruti cars. Higher Ground clearance gives a lot of peace of mind on Indian roads. Cons: Rear Seat comfort is compromised as rear passengers can feel the patchy roads. The suspension is not that good.'

Budget-Friendly: Wonderful Car. A nice compact car, it's one of my favorite cars and comes under a very medium budget which is best for middle-class families, it is a wonderful car., Car: Maruti Suzuki Ignis
Performance & Comfort : Amazing Performance. I own an Ignis Alpha Manual Transmission. I love the car. It is a beautiful drive and gives me between 19.7-20.9 km to the liter on Petrol. The pickup is great and it does not drop when switching on the Air Conditioner. The seats are comfortable and the steering light. The features are excellent for a small car. The ground clearance is comfortably.
'City Use : Good Car For City.For city driving, it is ok but needs to compromise with suspension. The mileage is good. Overall good car with better mileage and low service cost'
'Positive Feedback : Overall A Very Good Performance.Very good mileage and safety measures are also very good. The space in the car was great and the built quality of the car is also good.'
Engine Performance : Outstanding Car. Best in the segment due to 4 cylinder engine and pickup is too good and having a good build quality but not that much compares to other cars.
'Lackluster : Not That Good Car.I am owning a delta amt for 2 years. Pros: Automatic is the only pros Cons: Back view is ridiculously bad. Worst music system.Steering is completely lifeless. Narrow back seat. Never find a good seating position in the driver seat.Small glove box.Lack of utility pockets.Hard shock absorbers.Light weight.'
'Overall Satisfaction : Overall Good. Without Looking Back.Recently I booked Ignis from Nexa, Mysore. The vehicle front and side looking are very nice. But back looking is not satisfied. This should be a small change because of looks like 1935 old car. Nexa showroom sales executive Smt. Brunda is explaining about this vehicle very nicely. She advised and recommended this vehicle for our family budget.'
'Good Value: Good Performance. Nice experience with Ignis, good performance, comfort zone at a great price, and also reasonable, mileage is good, only issue with the car is a little bit of suspension.'
Value for Money : Overall Review Of The Car.Bought it a few months back for my dad. I bought the top variant of Ignis automatic and it cost me 50k less than Nexon first automatic model so it's not a cheap car by any measure. Though the value offered is nice for the price there are few things that I felt missing. The doors are hard to close by hand, Autolocking doesn't lock the car after some., Maruti Suzuki Ignis
'Best In Segment : Best In It's Segment. I have bought Ignis zeta class 1.2 cc in the last year, running across with 5000 km done, I don't have any complaint. Ignis car is the best car for the hilly urban area especially in the northeast region, engine performance and gear proportion ratio are good, it has styling features and look beautiful, avoid parking problems and garaging.'
'Highly Satisfactory : No Doubt Best Hatchback Under 600000 INR.I have completed 35k kilometers and never had any problem. And this car is fun to drive, great performance and mileage is very good and there is no tiredness to travel long distances. 5 out of 5 stars.'
City Car : Good City Car But Not For Long Drives. It has been 3 years since I got the Ignis Alpha Top Model Manual. It is a good city car with the best in class gearbox and clutch. But if you are looking for a vehicle which is comfortable for long road trips than this one is not for you. In Bombay roads, you can feel everything inside the cabin. and at the end of you will feel exhausted.
Limited Space : Space is not sufficient. Overall experience is good, the design of the back is not good and the shoulder room in the back seat is not sufficient.
Excellent Mileage and Safety : Bahut Achi Gaadi hai. Muje ye gaadi bahut achi lagi aur iska car mileage bahut he acha hai and safety bhi bahut sahe hai.
'Safety Concerns : Better Than Wagonr And Celerio.Pros Mileage Looks Safety Nexa service Cons Stiff suspension. Rear seat angle and no rear ac vent.'
'Value for Money : Mini Dynamite. This is a very good car for those buyers who wants a Suv under 1 million INR. This car has high ground clearance, suspension, comfortable seats, fog light, and a beautiful sporty look. If you want more than this then you have to spend more than 1 million INR for a car which is not possible for every person.'
Disappointment : Worse Than Expected.Worst car Ignis petrol 2019 and diesel is way better in every aspect. Don't go for the old petrol version diesel version is good, petrol one worst than expected. It felt like a Celerio petrol engine which is a failure.
Performance and Mileage : Ignis- A Good Option. Driving my Ignis delta model since January 2018. Till now drove it 30000 km. This car really a performance car. Stable on even at above 110km speed. A 1200cc engine will give you 18-19 kmpl mileage and above 20 kmpl on highway. But mileage mostly depends on how you drove your car. I am getting the above figure. Constantly since 2018. Boot space is good.
Perfect Compact Hatchback : IGNIS, A Perfect Compact Hatchback. I own Ignis Delta BS4. Perfect car for city drive as well as highway. It got good cabin space, great mileage, and the best car service from Nexa. Overall I am super happy with this car.
Quality Issue : Bad Quality Of Product. I have complained about the inside door rusting of my car Maruti Ignis delta amt within 3.3 years.
'Great Performance : Ignis- Super Performer.In 3 years, drove for 40000KM and till now no issues faced. Most smooth car in the midbudget. Stylish in looks. Highly Recommended.'
Smooth Performance : Superb Car. Wow, the car I have Ignis Zeta 2017 model. It is very smooth performing from the front side is very dashing but the tail end feels very small.
'Disappointing : Ignis 2020 Facelift, But Nothing Else! Ignis 2020 facelift looks good on the outer (front only), but inside there is no premium Nexa feel. Seems like it has the worst suspension in the market, especially in the rear seat. The new model seems lighter and less stable than the older BS4 versions. Looks like they have cut costs left, right, and center. Recommend not to cross 80kmph.'
'Comfortable and Feature-rich: Owing Petrol Delta Version. A Cool And Comfortable Car. Owing to a petrol delta version. A cool car for a small family, very comfortable seats, engine performance is excellent, it never lags even on highways and city. Best small in size makes parking easy and it is fully feature loaded.'
Value for Money : Awesome Car. Great car, highly affordable Ignis, value for money, looks compact but with excellent space inside, go for it.
'Good Experience : Nice Car, Good Mileage. Overall good experience with Ignis for the past 2 years. I am using the delta version. Truly none of a kind.'
Poor Customer Service : Very Bad Experience With Nexa Ignis Car not Good At All.Very bad experience with Nexa dealer Siliguri WB evoke road showroom.first of all they provide us six months old and little faded and rusted Ignis car and PDI was not done well. Deliver stranded car in haste and force us to purchase an extended warranty and 'my Nexa card' which is really useless and bug. After the purchase of a car very bad experience.
'Value for Money : Dream Car: Maruti Ignis. The car is very good and comfortable also on tough roads. Its performance is very good on the highway. Its mileage is about 22Km/ltr and in the city of 15km/ltr. Its comfort level is very good. AC is a very good cooling time is very less and the turning radius is very good being an automatic variant. Sometimes it glitched but overall value for money.'
'Fuel Efficiency : Milage And Long Driving Experience.This is an amazing car with awesome mileage. its performance is excellent and I got the new car BS6 Ignis. At last, I want to say that this is a wonderful car.'
Value for Money : Fun And Style. Wonderful car, good mileage and pickup are also good. Value for money and good AC. Ground clearance is good for all type of Roads.
'Fantastic Performance : Amazing Car. Recently bought it for my dad. This car is amazing. My dad loved it, especially the AMT version which let him add an extra feather in his cap.

<Good Engine, Poor Suspension : The engine is good, and it offers excellent ride position and height; it does not feel like a tin can. However, the rest is not good. It has a very poor suspension, low comfort level, and the boot space could be better. The handling is not as good as the Swift or Baleno, which have the same engine. The backseat is almost unusable due to the straight backrest and bumpy ride quality as the wheels are just below the backseat.>

There could be rear power windows and speakers, but as a budget car, I have no issue. Safety...

Those who are going for Alto 800 please have a look at S-Presso, it would be a better option. Better view, better seating position, better headroom, and legroom. Note: rear power windows and fog lamps are not even part of the top variant, which is disappointing.',
