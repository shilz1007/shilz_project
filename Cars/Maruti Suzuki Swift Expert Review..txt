Maruti Swift Expert Review.
Maruti Suzuki Swift Introduction.The Swift is something of an icon.The Swift facelift has received a new DualJet engine, more features and updated styling. A car with loads of character, genuine personality, and an identity of its own; it is a car that transcends Maruti’s otherwise utilitarian take on the hatchback. This is partly why it has achieved tremendous success in recent years.Maruti Suzuki Swift facelift: exterior design.Identifying the new 2021 Swift correctly, however, isn’t something that’s easy to do. In fact, unless you know exactly what to look for, it’s almost impossible to tell the new 2021 Swift apart. This, despite changes under the hood, new bits on the inside and a couple of changes on the outside as well.Updated mesh design grille with chrome bar a clear giveaway that this is a facelift.So just what should you look for to help tell it apart? One clear giveaway is the updated front grille. It now gets a slash of chrome running across from one side to the other, and then if you compare, there is now a mesh that’s finished in black, in place of the slats. Other than that, there are no significant changes to the outside.Little else has changed in terms of cosmetics.The Swift can now also be bought in two-tone finish in three options – white with a black roof, blue with a white top and the red Swift can now be had with a black roof. The car certainly looks more upmarket now due to the new colour scheme, but some of the Swift’s sporty lines do get lost with the two-tone scheme.Maruti Suzuki Swift facelift: interiors and equipment.On the inside, the 2021 Swift gets a SmartPlay Studio system that was introduced last year, and its coloured tile home screen stands out. There’s new upholstery on the seat, and top-of-the-line models now get cruise control and a colour screen between the dials. The mid-spec V variant gets a new 2-DIN system as well.Fully-loaded models gets a colour MID between the dials.The two updated screens add a bit of colour to the dash, the sporty design with its circular theme still works well (love those dials) and the seat with its extra side support holds you in place. Space and comfort in the back is decent too; apart from the slight lack of visibility out the side due to those ‘C’ pillar-mounted door handles. Though, besides this the cabin remains practically unchanged.Space and comfort is decent at the back though C-pillar-mounted door handles reduce outside visibility.Some of the plastics could have been more solidly built, and the car is missing some kit like connected tech and wireless charging, but, overall, the cabin is a comfortable place to be.Maruti Suzuki Swift facelift: engine.The biggest change, however, is under the hood. Known as the DualJet, this version of the K-series engine uses two injectors for every cylinder. This gives it greater control over the fuel injection, and greater power and efficiency as a result. Power now is up to 90hp, from 83hp, and the engine has a healthier torque curve as well. The Swift also gets idle start/stop, a first, and Maruti has improved claimed fuel economy by a massive 2kpl, to 23.2kpl.New 90hp 1.2-litre DualJet is not only more powerful but also more frugal.Like the Dzire before it, the first thing you notice when you fire up the engine is that it runs smoother. It’s in fact so smooth and vibration-free, that you barely notice it running in the background. It even idles at 600rpm without the air conditioning.There's more grunt low down which is great when driving in traffic.It’s also fairly responsive. It doesn’t quite leap off the line, but tap the accelerator and, by the time the engine has passed 1,200rpm, there’s a nice tug that gets progressively stronger the faster you spin the engine. Put your foot down to overtake slower traffic and again the effortless performance continues. The difference isn’t huge, but there clearly is more grunt at low engine speeds, and that’s great for when you are driving in traffic.Maruti Suzuki Swift facelift: performance and handling.Performance, though not thrilling, is stronger too. Hold the accelerator down and the 2021 Swift revs till 6,400rpm, with 0-100kph now coming up in 11.67sec, making it marginally quicker than the earlier car. The 100hp Hyundai Nios Turbo with its GDI petrol engine is, however, faster, with 100kph coming up in 9.82sec. For that matter, so is the Volkswagen Polo 1.0 TSI. Both smaller engines make good use of the turbo boost.Updated Swift is marginally quicker than the earlier car though it can't match it's turbocharged rivals.Otherwise, the darty, agile nature of the Swift remains unchanged. Light and easy to drive at low speeds, with very little effort needed to steer the car in traffic, and the harder you drive the Swift the nicer it gets. If only the steering offered a bit more feel at higher speeds. Even the slightly stiff low-speed ride is all but unchanged.Maruti Suzuki Swift facelift: Should I buy one?The Swift is not the fun car it once was. This is also true of the updated new model. That said, performance is marginally stronger, the engine is smoother and, when you put your foot down, power at low engine speeds is more accessible. It also remains light and easy to drive in traffic, is engaging and fun to drive when you up the pace, and with the rise in its claimed fuel efficieMaruti Suzuki Swift Introduction.There's no two ways to put it  the Swift is pretty much all the car I could want, or need. Especially in its diesel form, with the added bonus of it being an automatic. I can barely believe that last bit myself, what with it being an AMT gearbox and all that, but it's true. As big a fan that I am of a sweet, high-revving petrol motor and a slick manual gearbox, when it comes to keeping your sanity in the city intact, I'd say go automatic any day of the week!I'd only recently moved to Mumbai, and nothing, I repeat, nothing, can prepare you for just how mind-numbing peak hour traffic can be  especially in the monsoons. In fact, the first few weeks were spent behind the wheel of an SUV, that too with a manual gearbox and a heavy clutch! So experiencing the same traffic in a tiny hatchback that did all the work by itself was a real treat. I even managed to pack in half my life (luggage and odds and ends), moved straight out from the aforementioned SUV and into the Swift with its seats down!The dials look sporty.To recap, the Swift in the OD garage is a ZDi AGS, which means it's got a 1.3-litre diesel under the hood and a five-speed AMT. This is important to note, since there's no way to tell that by looking at the car. Maruti Suzuki is moving away from variant badges on most of its Nexa-distributed cars and it makes for a great clean look  pun intended, since it makes washing the car easier too. There's just the one badge to obsessively clean muck buildup around. Except the front grille, with its multiple slats, would be any Parsi's nightmare! I know it's an area I try to deep clean every once in a while but the good news is it doesn't look too in-your-face dirty even if you don't. Compulsive cleaning aside, I find myself looking back at it quite often, after I've parked it. That's the first good sign, isn't it?For a mass-market car, the seats are sporty and comfortableNext good sign is just how effortlessly it transforms from city-car to highway cruiser. The AMT does its job well in the city, only sometimes lurching forward instead of creeping, which is more than I can say for its other AMT counterparts. The shift from first to second can be accompanied by a longer pause than expected, but it's only an issue if you're trying to make a gap in traffic. Honestly, I'm used to it now and have learnt to drive around it  getting off the throttle for an instant helps it loads.But then when you're, say purely for example, running late for a shoot outside the city, it's more than happy to sit at highway speeds and give you the right gear when you need an overtake. Also, because it's only five gears, versus a more complicated seven-speed, it's not constantly switching gears on you to keep it in its optimal rev range, which makes it feel more natural to drive. Which at 100-120kmph is just between 2,000-2,500 revs, so it's fairly relaxed there too with plenty of torque still left. This of course reflects in its fuel efficiency, which reiterates my point of it being the only car you'll ever need. Through the worst of traffic, it's never dropped under 16kmpl! And on those high speed highway runs, it's usually closer to 17-18kmpl. Even though its tank is relatively small at 35 litres, that's a significant cruising range of over 550km!The Sun shade actually does fails to shield the face.The Bluetooth is iffy at times.I've spent most of my time behind the wheel, a very nice place to be despite the vague and hyper-reactive steering. That same nature makes it want to attack a corner, and I'm more than fine with that. I'd just perhaps like to see fatter rubber, with a lower sidewall section for more grip and less initial roll when you turn in. I know there are Swift owners out there with this setup, so weigh in please! It might make the already slightly-stiff ride worse, but I'm okay with that. For people using the Swift as a regular family car first, I've found dropping tyre pressure by 2-3psi to help, without impacting fuel efficiency. And for the same car to show characteristics that make it good in the city, fun outside it and still be efficient  I really don't see why you'd look anywhere else than at the Swift for an all-purpose car.ncy, it should be more efficient in the real world. What makes it even more appealing is the fact that it is comfortable on the inside and has a practical boot. It may not be quite as well equipped as rivals, there’s now no diesel, and this new one costing from INR 573000-841000 is between INR 15,000 to 25,000 more expensive. Still, there’s no denying the new Swift exerts an extremely strong pull, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it is one Maruti that is both, practical and fun.Maruti Suzuki Swift Review.Pros: Design, quality, dynamics.Cons: Clattery diesel, slow gear shifts.We quite liked the latest generation Maruti Suzuki Swift when we first drove it. You can read about it HERE.That one was a petrol model. And, it had a manual gearbox. Both of which, by the way, made it a driver’s delight. Sure, it wasn’t blisteringly fast, but the driver connect, the engine response and the way it handled, just make it a very likeable car.The car you see here might wear the same red hue, but look closer and you will find it has a different set of alloy wheels. And that’s because unlike the petrol manual we drove which was the top-of-the-line ZXI+ trim; our long-term diesel automatic is just a ZXI. Now, don’t beat yourself up if you couldn’t figure that out because as with many luxury car owners in Germany, Maruti has decided to do away with trim badging on the new Swift.As for our long-term car, it runs the tried and tested, and clattery 1.3-litre diesel from Fiat. It makes 74bhp and 190Nm of torque. So, it’s not the most powerful engine in its class. Or, the most refined. Or, one with the most linear power delivery. But, it is known to be extremely fuel-efficient; one can’t get an ARAI figure of 28.4kmpl just like that!The rest of the car – the mechanicals, the cabin, the quality and the overall look and feel – is similar to the petrol. But, how similar? And, will it be as much fun? Will it also be easier to live with? Or, will the AMT play spoilsport and make our long term experience a chore?All this and more in the next installation of the Maruti Suzuki Swift diesel AMT Long Term review. Stay tuned.Maruti Suzuki Swift Review.If you have been a fan of the Maruti Suzuki Swift, you would find the new third-generation model to be rather intriguing, even if it isn’t the last word in cabin space or plush ride quality. I have been running one, in the ever-so-practical diesel AMT spec, for the last few months and have come to this conclusion that it is truly practical and one of the most relevant small cars one can buy right now. As revealed in our previous long term report, the Swift has been an impressive daily driver, with its big car feel and great highway manners. That being said, I was keen to talk about how it fares within the city limits. Is it easy to drive? Easy to look out of and park? Read on to find out.Besides seeing plenty of action during my commute between Kalyan and Navi Mumbai, the Swift has been a frequent visitor to our in-house studio in Pune. Its nippy diesel engine offers enough punch to zip through the choked streets, while the quick steering and the grown-up chassis form a perfect match when the road clears up and you want to have some fun. The tight proportions also mean parking the Swift into tight spaces isn’t that big a deal. That said, the thick C-pillar is worrisome when you have to park at night or in low light conditions. Also, our test car is one below the top-spec ZDi Plus AMT trim and misses out on parking assist – a rear view camera would definitely come in handy.The five-speed AMT is among the smoothest I have experienced in budget diesel cars and it makes the Swift an incredibly relaxing car to drive, thanks in no small part to the supportive seats and the well laid-out controls that are easily accessible even on the move. I have put thousands of kilometres on the clock driving purely in the city and not once has the average fuel efficiency dipped below 15kmpl, so it’s a legit inexpensive to run hatchback, one that I have grown to like with every passing month.Any negatives after six months? A couple, yes. Although the all-black cabin looks really neat, it’s not as robust as I would have liked – there is a hint of squeak coming from the front seat rails and a rattle from the passenger-side of the dashboard as well. Secondly, the AMT, especially because of the spiky power delivery of the diesel engine, is somewhat jerky when pressing on, however, under light throttle it’s a smooth operator and leaves little room for complaints. All in all, the Swift continues to be impressive and I remain convinced that it’s the best midsize premium hatch you can buy, and by a fair margin.Maruti Suzuki Swift:  Good ergonomics, quality.Cons: lack of touchscreen system.It’s already been two months since one of India’s most popular hatchbacks entered our long term garage. Yes, we are talking about the Swift and in our case, we have been driving the ZDi AGS powered model.In our first report, we introduced you to the car and gave you some background with regard to what we would be working with. In this first deep dive report, we decided to provide an insight into its features and some of the cabin ergonomics as this is one of the first things that catches the attention of the buyer once they get into a rhythm with the vehicle.Back in black.The all-black theme has been carried over from the previous generation car, but now it comes with an improvement in terms of plastic quality. The centre console gets soft touch plastics while the rest of the dash gets a harder standard material with a grainy surface which might not be very attractive to look at, but it does have a nice feel to it. There’s also a large silver insert on the dashboard as well and little chrome bezels for everything and these elements do well to contrast the black plastics. Of particular notice is also the instrument cluster. The fonts are clear and the chrome ring around the display prevents glare from blocking out the view.Since getting the car and putting it to the daily grind, we have discovered that the ergonomics are quite good and one of the places this is quite visible is in the climate control dials. The whole set up comprises of three dials with the centre one being a display for the readout. The temperature and fan speed dials have a system where each increase or decrease is felt through clicks that the dial makes. It might seem like a simple thing but it will allow the user to gain muscle memory with regard to operating the system, thereby allowing them to be focussed on the road for longer.Two other neat touches we found were with the front cup holders and the positioning of the phone function switches on the steering. The cup holders are wide and rectangular, a shape that allows them to be used to keep a wider range of stuff. Positioning the telephony switches where they are means one hand is always available to keep a firm grip on the wheel at all times.Moving on to the stuff that didn’t sit so well with us, it is surprising to see that Maruti Suzuki only offers the touchscreen system on the top-of-the-line ‘+’variants. This is a feature that is definitely popular with buyers and bringing in even one with a smaller display would have surely raised the stakes.One door at a time.Another feature that we found cumbersome was that keyless entry system only opens the driver’s door when you activate it the first time and needs to be clicked again to open the other doors. That being said, I feel that finding this feature cumbersome is mostly because till date we have been used to keyless entry systems opening all the doors of the car when activated. But if one thinks about it, one can see that this method of opening just the driver’s door on first click makes the car more secure, especially in public parking spaces.Next month.In our next report, we will be looking at how the Swift performs out on the highway. With the South West monsoon season just around the corner, it looks like a trip from Mumbai to Goa is in order and that should give me an idea of what this car is like on the blacktop and through the ghats that dot the route and region of my travel.Maruti Suzuki Swift Introduction.The seventh model to be included in Maruti Suzuki’s growing CNG line-up is the carmaker’s popular hatchback, the Swift. Almost five months after the launch of the Maruti Suzuki Dzire CNG, the Swift sits between Wagon R and Dzire and aims to offer a mix of affordability and a feature-rich hatchback. While it benefits from an alternate fuel powertrain, let us take a detailed look at what all has changed with this update.Maruti Suzuki Swift Engine and Performance.In its CNG guise, the Swift’s 1.2-litre Dual Jet Dual VVT petrol engine produces 76bhp and 98.5Nm of peak torque. As anticipated, the power is down by 13bhp and 14Nm when compared to its petrol counterpart. However, the Swift CNG makes up for it with a claimed fuel efficiency of 30.90km/kg.In comparison to its direct rivals, the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios CNG is underpowered than Swift where it puts out 68bhp and 95Nm of torque. On the other hand, the Tata Tiago CNG has a marginally lower output of 72bhp and 95Nm of peak torque. Furthermore, the claimed ARAI fuel efficiency figures of both these CNG hatchbacks are well under 30km/kg. As a result, the Swift CNG, at least on paper, is more powerful and frugal than its competitors.Maruti Suzuki Swift Prices and Competition.The Maruti Suzuki Swift CNG is available in two variants — VXi and ZXi. While the former is priced at INR 777000, the latter is positioned above it and commands a premium of INR 68,000, with a price tag of INR 845000 both prices, ex-showroom. Both the variants are INR 95,000 costlier than their petrol equivalents.Talking about competition, the Grand i10 Nios CNG can be had in Magma and Sportz variants that are priced at INR 716000 and INR 770000, respectively both prices, ex-showroom. Meanwhile, the Tata Tiago is the only hatchback to be offered in four variants that range from INR 630000 to INR 773000 ex-showroom, making it the most affordable option in the pack.Maruti Suzuki Swift Exterior.Visually, the Maruti Suzuki Swift CNG has no enhancements and looks similar to the outgoing model. The front is dominated by a single-piece front grille with horizontal chrome embellishment and fog lamps with black casing. While the ZXi is fitted with 15-inch alloy wheels with a silver finish, the VXi makes do with smaller 14-inch steel rims with wheel covers. Maruti also claims to have retuned the suspension to offer better ride quality.Besides this, the Swift continues to be offered with body-coloured ORVMs with turn indicators, LED tail lamps, and C-pillar-mounted rear door handles. Notably, the LED projector headlamps with integrated LED DRLs along with dual-tone alloys are limited only to the top-spec ZXi+ petrol variant.Maruti Suzuki Swift Interior.With a price difference of INR 68,000 between the VXi and ZXi variants, the lower variant loses out on features like a leather-wrapped steering wheel, front fog lamps, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, a push start/stop button, electrically-foldable outside mirrors, 60:40 split rear seats, auto-up function for driver side window, and a rear wiper.Having said that, the top ZXi+ variant that is limited only to a petrol powertrain offers comfort and convenience features like cruise control, auto headlamps, and a reverse parking camera. All variants are equipped with dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, reverse parking sensors, Isofix child seat anchorages, and a seat-belt reminder buzzer for front seats.Maruti Suzuki Swift Review.We continue our journey with the fourth generation Maruti Suzuki Swift in our long term garage and this time around, we have a highway report. I finally managed to take a break from my busy schedule and headed for my hometown in South Maharashtra for a short vacation.What´s more, shortly after I returned, the Swift took off on another long journey. This time, it was my colleague Pratheek from BikeWale  who took the car on a trip to Chikmagalur, in Karnataka and back. He did this 1700km roundtrip to participate in Dakar Ace CS Santosh’s Great Trail Adventure (head over to BikeWale to read all about his experience). So you can see that it has been quite an eventful month for our little diesel hatchback and here is everything that we found out.The all-important question of ‘kitna deti hai highway pe’ has been answered and it looks quite impressive. In real world conditions and with two different drivers and varied road conditions, the Swift with its five-speed automated manual transmission was able to give us an efficiency of 20.4kmpl. What’s more even after knocking off 498kms, we still had a quarter of a tank and a possible range of up to 116km giving us a total of 614km.Now, the car has a 37-litre tank and an ARAI F.E figure of 28.4kmpl which would put the total theoretical range at 1050km, a mighty impressive figure but a bit hard to achieve. We feel that our 614km figure is equally impressive when you consider that this is in real world conditions. However, given that this is a diesel variant, we wouldn’t recommend that you push your luck with regard to how far you can go in terms of distance and you should tank up if your DTE readout drops to under 50km.On both journeys, the car clocked over 1000km. There were no issues with regard to seating as all the occupants were very comfortable. The well contoured seats provided enough support all around while the pliant ride meant, the car took most of rutted rural roads without losing its composure too much.Added to this mix was the fact that my family had recently brought in a four-legged member to the troupe. Ray really enjoyed his first big car journey and this has lead me to believe that he definitely gives a paws-up! To the Swift as a highway companion.Next month, I’ll bring you my experiences of what the Swift is like in its home turf- the city. We will able to give you an idea of what it is like to manoeuvre in tight spaces, drive in bumper-to-bumper traffic as well as answer the second most important F.E question of mileage.Maruti Suzuki Swift Pros.Fun to drive,Smooth and efficient petrol engine,Effortless aftersales experienceMaruti Suzuki Swift Cons.Lacks new-age features,Build quality not the best,Firm low speed ride.Maruti Suzuki Swift Verdict.Finding a proper jack-of-all-trades hatchback is not as easy as it sounds. For all intents and purposes, your regular hatch is either comfortable or a hoot to drive. Value oriented or outright premium. Backed by a household name or a relatively newer brand. However, complications become apparent when a hatchback tries to do everything well all at once. Which is what makes the Maruti Suzuki Swift such a fascinating proposition. On sale since 2005, the Swift has always been particularly sporty to drive and to look at but lacking in terms of rear-seat space and equipment. In 2018 Maruti did improve the thing on all those counts with the third-gen model which is not only stylish and fun to drive but also a genuinely comfortable family hatch.Three years on, the Swift has now been refreshed with a substantial engine update and additional equipment. Here’s what all you get in the 2021 model year update.Maruti Suzuki Swift Engine and Performance.The most improved bit of the 2021 Swift is its engine. It is still Maruti’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder K-Series engine but with improved combustion tech. In fact, the engine gets 2 injectors per cylinder and variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust valves. The Swift now makes 90bhp (up from 83bhp) and 113Nm of torque, both handy if not remarkable figures. Maruti Suzuki says they have also improved the fuel efficiency and lowered the emissions of this K-Series motor by adding idle stop/start tech and improving the EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) system.As a result, claimed fuel efficiency is now as much as 23.20kmpl for the manual and 23.76kmpl for the AMT version. Now there wasn’t enough time to put these figures to test but we did manage to strap our specialist timing gear onto the new Swift to eke out acceleration and roll-on figures.Predictably, the new, more powerful Swift posted a slightly quicker 0-100kmph time of 11.75 seconds compared to the old car ,12.26 seconds. In terms of roll-on acceleration, it did 20-80kmph in third in 14.35 seconds and 40-100kmph in fourth in 16.90 seconds, making it decently responsive. More than raw numbers we ended the day highly impressed with how refined this new K-Series motor is. It is outstandingly quiet and smooth with no vibrations whatsoever for the most part. Sure, this naturally aspirated engine is no match for the power delivered by the new range of 1-litre turbo motors but the new Swift is still plenty quick and moves forward with enough gusto. Unfortunately, if you want a hot Swift, there isn’t one at the moment but given its looks, there should be.Maruti Suzuki Swift Ride and Handling.Those familiar with the pre-facelift Swift, or even the Baleno or the Ignis for that matter, would identify similarities in the way the new Swift rides over different surfaces. Maruti hasn’t altered the ride and handling set up, meaning the low speed ride still borders on a firmer side although we would like to add that the Swift is in no way uncomfortable over broken roads. Sure, you can hear the suspension working over pot holes and expansion joints but the overall ride quality remains pleasant and flat. The light steering is excellent for driving in traffic but is likely to leave some drivers wanting for more weight and feedback when driven spiritedly. Thankfully the Swift now gets a self-centering rack which makes low speed driving a lot more reassuring. All in all, the light steering combined with a reactive front-end makes the Swift feel quite dart-y. The only downer is the economy-minded Apollo Alnac tires which struggle to remain quiet and lose traction earlier than expected when you are really going for it.Maruti Suzuki Swift Interior Space and Quality.The cabin design and layout is untouched for the next generation model. That said, it remains among the better looking/packaged interiors in its segment. Like before, the Swift gets a seemingly sporty all-black cabin whereas the Dzire is shipped with a more mature looking beige interior and just like before, the dashboard is minimalistic yet smartly styled with the large infotainment display dominating proceedings. Plastic quality remains good for the segment with fit and finish similarly ranked, however, there are still some mediocre bits to be seen out in the open – the door panel and the center stack appear too shiny and a little hard. Overall, the fit and finish is decent but it cannot match the likes of the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios or the Volkswagen Polo.The Swift isn’t the largest hatchback in its class yet it has a fairly long wheelbase which means the doors are large enough and they open wide for easy entry and exit. Interior space remains unchanged and that’s not a bad thing at all. The 2021 Swift continues to be a comfortable family hatch with large and accommodating front seats and a good deal of leg space. The rear bench offers excellent back support and while the legroom is on par with the segment, under-thigh support is particularly good since the seat is set fairly high.Maruti Suzuki Swift Features and Safety.The tech stuff is headlined by Maruti’s Smartplay infotainment system which is now featured across their range. Although not the sleekest system, it is fairly easy to use and comes with smartphone mirroring and now with a host of cloud-based services. The audio quality and output is on par with the segment, however, the lack of physical buttons to control everything is bothersome on the move. The 2021 Swift comes with dual front airbags, ABS, a reversing camera with guidelines and parking sensors but there is more to the safety story. With the update, you also get ESP, bigger brakes on both ends and a recalibrated steering with self-centering to improve things further. In terms of comfort features, cruise control and key synchronized electrically foldable wing mirrors have been added to the top-spec variant, however, the Swift misses out on a few new-age features like rear AC vents and wireless charging, that ideally should be standard on the top-spec variant for this kind of money.Maruti Suzuki Swift Conclusion.There is a lot to like about the 2021 Swift and the way it looks despite the lack of any substantial visual changes. It’s a thoroughly modern design, without being zany, and has a solid evenness in its lines and creases and that’s something which is becoming rare in new car designs. There aren’t many hatchbacks that look this good and drive this well and with the 2021 update, you also get more equipment and safety features for your money. More importantly, the fact that the Swift is backed by the most trusted brand in the business also helps its cause.Now although the 2021 Swift doesn’t address all of the previous model’s foibles, namely the firm low speed ride, lack of new-age features and hard plastics, it is still plenty likeable and the improved petrol engine and driving experience should be enough to comfortably keep it on top of the sales chart.Maruti Suzuki Swift Introduction.Back in 2005, Maruti was still by far the biggest car maker in the country, but their products were uninspiring and getting long in tooth. Cars like the Esteem, Wagon R, Baleno and the Zen were well past their prime and they were merely selling because of the peace of mind ownership experience. But the landmark car that changed how people perceived Maruti and showed company the way for future products, was the Swift.It felt young, was fun to drive and appealed to the youth, as well as the brand loyalist. With over 1.7 million units of the car sold in the past 12 years, Swift’s success story is unprecedented. Now the third generation of this sporty hatch is about to be launched at the Auto Expo and we were lucky to get behind the wheel to find out if it can live up to the high expectations.Previously we reviewed the petrol version and came away impressed. Is the diesel variant as exciting? Read-on to find out.Starting with aesthetics, Suzuki designers have tried hard to differentiate the Swift from the Dzire. Upfront the single piece matte black plastic grille looks sporty and also more purposeful thanks to the omission of the chrome surround from the Dzire. The new front bumper with a sharply cut chin further adds to its appeal. In profile it looks exactly the same as the Dzire till the B pillar, post which the rear door and tail section is all-new. The unusual placement of the rear door handle, while not the most convenient when your hands are full, makes it look like a sporty three door. The top ZDi plus variant gets diamond cut 15 inch alloys, while the lower ZDi variant gets smaller 14 inch simple wheels. At the back, the Swift looks a bit too simple, especially the large boot section, where Maruti could have added a crease or two to jazz it up a bit. In fact it reminds us of the Nissan Micra, which isn’t exactly a compliment.Based on the new Heartec platform that also underpins the Baleno and the Dzire, the Swift has shed around 85 kg as compared to the old car despite it being a larger car. Maruti also claims the new Swift to be crash compliant to the upcoming safety norms. With Maruti being the only manufacturer to have their own crash test facility in India, it is hard to argue with that assertion.Maruti Suzuki Swift Interior.Unsurprisingly, the Swift shares most of the interior bits from the Dzire, but like with the exterior, designers have done a good job of differentiating the two thanks to small changes and different interior colour. The Swift gets an all black cabin as compared to the beige on the Dzire, which goes down well for a sporty hatch. Other changes are on the centre console where you now get sporty looking round centre vents and air-con controls with silver surround. The Dzire’s wood finish is replaced by silver accents which again add to the style and ambiance. The dashboard design is minimalistic but smartly styled, with the large touchscreen infotainment system dominating proceedings. Unfortunately, the automatic version of the Swift doesn’t come in the top variant, so you get a get a traditional music system with a dot matrix display that looks outdated. The touchscreen system on the top ZDi plus variant features a screen that is crisp, is easy to use and is of high quality. The same can’t be said about the rest of the cabin though. Plastic quality and fit and finish though decent is not as nice as the Hyundai Grand i10 and the dash graining also could have been better.The front seats are big and the heavily contoured backrest offers good support. The extra cabin width also helps in giving you an airy feeling. But it’s at the back where the new Swift has taken a big leap forward. Despite it being 10mm shorter than the outgoing car, the new Swift offers much more kneeroom and the wider cabin gives it an airy ambiance. The bench itself is well shaped and comfortable. What would have made the rear seat even better is firmer cushioning. There are plenty of storage spaces in the cabin in the form of multiple cubby holes and even the glovebox is of decent size. The boot at 268 litres is much bigger than before but like with the old car the lid opening is quite high and narrow, which makes loading heavy bags a shoulder straining affair.In the top ZDi plus trim the Swift comes equipped with touchscreen infotainment system which houses Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, navigation and a music system. Apart from this you also get all the basics like climate control, key-less go, reverse camera with sensors, auto headlamps, daytime running lamps, LED headlamps and a comprehensive trip computer. In terms of safety, Maruti sets a new benchmark by offering two airbags and ABS as standard across the range. You also get ISO fix anchors for a child seat, as standard.Maruti Suzuki Swift Driving experience.Lets start with the automated manual transmission car first. As compared to the petrol auto, you can feel the inherent jerkiness of the gearbox even more in the diesel, especially during full burst acceleration, as you get that typical AMT pause as the hydraulic actuators struggle to upshift quickly to keep up the momentum. But when you drive smoothly this automated manual transmission works well on the highway and part throttle gearshifts are relatively smooth. You also get a creep function which is a boon in stop-start traffic. But it does take a second or two to hook-up which is troublesome especially on slopes where the car tends to roll back. The car feels best in manual mode and there is a way of getting around this drawback by just lifting off before every shift. Overall if you want a polished automatic transmission then you have to look in some other segment as the Swift is the only car to offer the diesel automatic option.Moving onto the manual transmission car, performance feels much better and though there is some turbo lag below 2000rpm it feels smooth enough. There is a nice zing past 2000rpm and the strong midrange adds punch in the proceedings. The engine is free revving too but it does sound rough and gets noisy past 3500rpm. The refinement at medium engine speeds is good, mainly thanks to the good sound insulation. The gearbox too is a joy to use and the snappy shifts and short throws makes it a joy to use.We also noticed the diesel car felt more supple than the petrol which we think is due to the heavier engine. The ride feels settled at low speeds but you do feel the suspension thump over sharp bumps if you don’t slow down enough. Though it never gets to the point of being uncomfortable and it is something you can live with. However, as you go faster, it settles down to offer a flat and consistent ride.The Swift diesel’s handling balance is extremely sporty, as the rear breaks traction if you trail brake into a corner with no understeer whatsoever. It is easy to control it thanks to the torquey diesel engine. But for an average driver this can get a bit unnerving as there is no ESP to help out. The steering calibration felt much better on the diesel car with it having more weight and feeling more consistent as compared to the petrol. The brakes, like on the petrol, offer good bite and stopping power with good pedal feel.Maruti Suzuki Swift Verdict.Purely as a package we would recommend you to go for the petrol engine Swift as it is more refined, frugal enough and is more involving to drive. Even the AMT gearbox works better on the petrol and is the one to go for if you are going to be commuting mostly in the city. The diesel on the other hand is not bad at all, as it has good grunt and will prove to be extremely economical. Even the automatic option is worth considering if you spend long hours in he city or on the highway. Be it petrol or diesel the new Swift is a formidable attempt by Maruti and they have managed to address all the issues and improve on the good points of the outgoing car.The Maruti Swift rivals the likes of Hyundai i10, Nissan Micra and Ford Figo. Where the old car was priced at par with the competition the new Swift might become the most expensive in its segment.
